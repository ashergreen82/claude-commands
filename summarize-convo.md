# Summarize Conversation

The context window is filling up. Please create a detailed handoff summary for a new agent with the following sections:
**Original Goal:** What was the user's original request or objective?
**Work Completed:** List all tasks finished, including files created/modified (with full paths), key decisions made and reasoning, and problems solved.
**Current State:** What is the current status? Is something in progress or partially complete?
**Remaining Work:** What still needs to be done to fully complete the original goal?
**Key Technical Context:** Important details the next agent needs - relevant file paths and their purposes, architecture or patterns being used, any gotchas or issues discovered.
**Handoff Prompt:** Provide a copy-paste ready prompt I can give to the next agent that includes all the context it needs to continue seamlessly.
